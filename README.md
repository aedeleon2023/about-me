Today I figured out how to make the prompts work with multiple answers, and multiple prompts.  Huge accomplishment!  I kind of hated JavaScript when I left 102.  For the life of me, I couldn’t make it work.  Now, it just makes logical sense.  Very excited to learn more!

Today has been a pretty bad day.  I am hitting a wall with JavaScript again.  I would just like to look at the correct type of code that is being asked for in our lab, and then have it explained to me what each part of the code does.  Good luck on the internet.  I am having a very difficult time understanding the reading material.  There is just so much.  

It’s late.  I will reflect on the wise words of Scarlett O’Hara, Tomorrow is another day.

Jose and I worked on this together. We updated the functions from question one through seven. We both agree that working together was much easier than last night's lab.

Today was another long one, but way more fruitful.  Talked with many TAs, my lab partner, Jose, and my two accountability partners, Timothee and Xavier.  We have some pretty terrific people in this class.  Was very impressed with their intelligence and talent.  

Learned quite a bit about arrays, and finally, honestly, I can say I appreciate them.  I may not like them, but I can see their value.  Getting more familiar with loops.  Can’t wait to be good friends.  Seriously, can’t wait for the weekend to take a breath and cement some of this in my brain.  Right now, I’ve been invaded and it’s all kinds of chaos happening in there.  Yep, just looking forward to the calm, and a chance for it to settle in.  

Just saw the calendar, and it looks like an extra busy one tomorrow.  Will stay up late again.  It’s 11:20 P.M. now.  Learned this last week, that no matter how well-intentioned I am at night, with my thoughts of waking up early to get the reading notes done, it won’t happen.  So I will stay up and get those completed before sleep can happen.

Today was a better day.  Didn't get a chance to work much on here, but I will be back.  Have all weekend to use CSS to make you pretty.
