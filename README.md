Today I figured out how to make the prompts work with multiple answers, and multiple prompts.  Huge accomplishment!  I kind of hated JavaScript when I left 102.  For the life of me, I couldn’t make it work.  Now, it just makes logical sense.  Very excited to learn more!

Today has been a pretty bad day.  I am hitting a wall with JavaScript again.  I would just like to look at the correct type of code that is being asked for in our lab, and then have it explained to me what each part of the code does.  Good luck on the internet.  I am having a very difficult time understanding the reading material.  There is just so much.  

It’s late.  I will reflect on the wise words of Scarlett O’Hara, Tomorrow is another day.  

Lab Four - 7/14/22 Navigator: Angela DeLeon Driver: Jose Gonzalez

Angela and I worked on this together. We updated the functions from question one through seven. We both agree that working together was much easier than last night's lab.
